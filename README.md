Forecasting Net Prophet
This challenge demonstrates how to find and predict patterns and behavors. 

The assumption is that you are a growth analyst at MercadoLibre. With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. You've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, you want to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

The challenge is divided into 4 steps (5th step is optional).

Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

Step 5 (optional): Forecast revenue by using time series models
